# FDP Discussion and parts recommendation
We had productive session with professor Sanjeev where we discussed the following for the Final Design Presentation (FDP):
- A parts list that outlines specs and engineering decisions as to why these parts were picked needs to be outlined clearly
- A CAD model with engineering analysis done on the system. For eg - an analysis of how much RPM is required for the VTOL to lift or how much RPM is required for the 
- A flowchart that outlines the software architecture of the system

We also discussed about some recommendations to selecting lightweight cameras for our hardware topology. The end result was to select something that was small and reliable, similar to an Iphone Camera.
