While we are waiting for stakeholders to tell us the challenges and requirements in our project, we wanted to get opinions from our advisors about the feasibility of our favourite solutions.

# Fixed-Wing VTOL or Quadcopter

Like most other capstone project groups, what drew us together was an ambitious engineering concept.
That is an autonomously navigating drone that can dock itself when it needs to be recharged.
Now is the time we decide which aircraft both satisfies our engineering curiosities and the current objective.
Conventional quadcopter or a fixed-wing VTOL drone?

We leaned towards building a fixed-wing VTOL more or less from first principles because we all loved solving design problems and wanted to make our own attempt at improving the range of unmanned aircrafts.
Professor Bedi encouraged us to work on what we care about the most.
