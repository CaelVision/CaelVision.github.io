# Outreach

After speaking to our advisor, he suggested we reach out to Professor Mahesh. We learned that OPG was not in fact our primary contact, transmission line inspection is actually done by **Hydro-One**. We also learned that the primary thing being inspected are the **insulators** on the transmission lines. Their failure is uncommon, but calamitous.

Historically, this work was done by a helicopter, you needed a pilot, fuel, inspectors, etcâ€¦ We finally have a solid problem statment: "Autonomously inspect transmission line for insulator failure".

# V-TOL

This problem statments aligns with the group's interest in building a V-TOL, the design is well suited for long-range applications.
