# Outreach

We thought that roads and bridges in the trans-Canada highway were critical pieces of infrastruture that stretch over vast parts of rural Canada.
That's why we wanted to make contact with civil engineers who inspected and repaired them.
An engineer in the City of Kitchener pointed us to two the two firms that the city contracted for bridge inspection in the past, WSP and AECOM.

We took a field trip to the offices of WSP and AECOM, civil engineering companies who we were hoping to glean some insight from. We received the contact information of a few individuals that can hopefully helps us narrow down our problem statment. During an initial conversation  ith an AECOM engineer, he pointed out a few problems with metallic bridge wear, the biggest being rust.

# Current UAV

Our idea is that the UAV is capable not only of inspection, but environement interaction as well.

Te- UAV should ale rt the engineer and wait for approval before any environement interaction is done


Turns out that their scope is much smaller than we expected. The infrastructure they inspect does not require automation to the degree that was imagined.
